### AntV Algorithm

It is an algorithm package of AntV, mainly includes graph related algorithms:

- adjacentMatrix: calculate the adjacency matrix for graph data
- connectedComponent: calculate the connected components for graph data
- degree: calculate the in degree, out degree, and total degree for nodes
- detectCycle: detect the cycles of the graph data
- dfs: depth-first search algorithm
- dijkstra: Dijkstra shortest path algorithm
- findPath: find the shortest paths and all paths for two nodes by Dijkstra
- floydWarshall: Floyd Warshall shortest path algorithm
- labelPropagation 标签传播自动聚类
- louvain: LOUVAIN clustering algorithm
- labelPropagation: Label Propagation(LP) clustering algorithm
- pageRank: page rank algorithm for nodes ranking
- neighbors: find the neighbors for a node in the graph
- minimumSpanningTree: generate the minimum spanning tree for a grpah
- GADDI: graph structural and semantic pattern matching algorithm

All the algorithms above supports to be calculated with web-worker.
